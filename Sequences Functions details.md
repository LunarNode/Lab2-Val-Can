Under the Package NumberGenerator, there are two subpackages. One of the subpackages is called Sequences.
Here is the list of functions that are in the three modules of Sequences:

def finite_series()

- Asks the user for the lower and upper bound
- generates the series for each of the three kinds of series (Triangle, Square, Pentagon)

def infinite_series()

- Asks the user for just the upper bound
- generates the series for each of the three kinds of series (Triangle, Square, Pentagon)

def mean(), def get_mean()

- Calculates the mean of the user-generated series

def Median(), def get_Median()

- Calculates the median of the user-generated series

def display()

- Helper function that customizes the user input interaction more visually appealing

def get_range()

- Gets lower and upper bound for number series generation
